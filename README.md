# LifeSatisfaction
Investigating the aspects of life that have the greatest impact on life satisfaction

Most humans share an innate yearning to find satisfaction and happiness in their lives, and it is this yearning which led me to create this project. This project looks at the current happiness, annual income, and many other aspects of the lives of Somerville Residents to find out what has the greatest impact on life satisfaction. I use Multiple Linear Regression and Ordinal Logistic Regression models to find and analyze the aspects of life with the strongest relationships to life satisfaction.

## Project Motivation
My goal is to investigate the questions asked to the residents of Somerville in order to identify the aspects of life with the strongest relationship to happiness. Happiness is a state which is rather challenging to quantify and attribute, so I do not intend to find the source of happiness. However, I am excited to learn more about what the happy people of Somerville have in common. I am thrilled to see what interesting connections I will discover in this happiness survey.
